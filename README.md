## 🌟 Bishal Thakur's Netflix inspired Portfolio 🌟 - https://bishalthakur0.github.io/Portfolio_Bishal_Thakur

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! 🚀 This website showcases my work, skills, and experiences in web development. It's designed to be lightweight, customizable, and professional while maintaining an approachable style.

This project is a personal portfolio website built with React, designed to showcase your work, skills, and experiences. It features a Netflix-inspired interface, making it engaging and visually appealing. The project uses `react-router-dom` for navigation, allowing for a single-page application experience. It also integrates with DatoCMS for dynamic content management, which is a great feature for easily updating your portfolio without redeploying the entire application. The use of `gh-pages` simplifies the deployment process to GitHub Pages, providing a free and accessible hosting solution.
